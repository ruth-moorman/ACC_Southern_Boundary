This is a bit unorganised but I wan't to keep a record of the code and my general thoughts.

In this project I was trying to answer the question (mostly to myself) of what is the boundary between the ACC dominated Southern Ocean and the "subpolar" Gyre dominated Southern Ocean? I looked at various watermass motivated definitions put forward by Orsi et al 1995, and I spent a lot of time on SSH/Barotropic streamfunction based definitions. I found that the MOM6 models have a bias where the subpolar southern ocean is contracted (i.e. the gyres are contracted) particularly in the Pacific sector. The Ross Gyre is contracted and weak. I was interested in whether changes in the structure of the Ross Gyre and the way it transitions into the ACC might influence the poleward transport of heat (didn't get far on this question, teh answer seems to be complicated). Also, I looked into the variability of the gyre region.
